Yes, Windows 10 has a "virtual desktops" feature, also known as "multiple desktops" or "workspaces." It allows you to create separate desktop environments to organize your open applications and improve productivity.

Here's a quick overview of how to use it:

* **Task View:** The primary way to manage virtual desktops is through the **Task View**. You can open it by:
    * Clicking the **Task View icon** on the taskbar (it looks like two overlapping rectangles).
    * Pressing **Windows Key + Tab**.

* **Creating a New Desktop:**
    * In Task View, click on **"New desktop"** (usually at the bottom right).
    * Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut: **Windows Key + Ctrl + D**.

* **Switching Between Desktops:**
    * Open Task View and click on the desktop you want to switch to.
    * Use the keyboard shortcuts: **Windows Key + Ctrl + Left Arrow** or **Windows Key + Ctrl + Right Arrow**.

* **Moving Windows Between Desktops:**
    * Open Task View.
    * Hover over the desktop containing the window you want to move.
    * **Drag and drop** the window to the desired virtual desktop.
    * Alternatively, **right-click** on the window's thumbnail in Task View, select "Move to," and then choose the desktop.

* **Closing a Desktop:**
    * Open Task View.
    * Hover over the desktop you want to close, and an **"X"** will appear in the top right corner. Click it.
    * Use the keyboard shortcut: **Windows Key + Ctrl + F4** (this closes the desktop you are currently on). Any open windows on that desktop will be moved to an adjacent desktop.

**Key benefits of using virtual desktops:**

* **Organization:** Separate work, personal, and project-specific applications.
* **Reduced Clutter:** Keep your main desktop cleaner by moving less frequently used apps to other desktops.
* **Improved Focus:** Dedicate a desktop to a specific task to minimize distractions.
* **Presentations:** Prepare different sets of applications for a presentation on different desktops for seamless transitions.

While Windows 10's virtual desktops are a great feature, some users note that it doesn't allow for completely independent monitor layouts across desktops (meaning if you have multiple physical monitors, switching a virtual desktop on one will switch it on all). However, for basic organization and workflow improvement, it's very effective.
